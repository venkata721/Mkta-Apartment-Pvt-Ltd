&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sophisticated Craftsman home, with its spacious interior design, is both flexible and dramatic. A three-car garage, screened porch, spacious country kitchen, optional 1,535 sq. ft. bonus area, and an optional (for a fee) 2,352 sq. ft. basement make this home irresistible! Relax in the luxurious master suite which includes a tray ceiling, a sitting area, His and Hers walk-in closets, and an exquisite bath. The country kitchen boasts a walk-in pantry and opens to the vaulted family room.
         A French door leads to the vaulted screened porch. The deck is accessible from both the screened porch and master bedroom. A decorative square column and tray ceiling adorn the elegant dining room. Bedrooms two and three each feature walk-in closets and individual baths. Tucked behind the functional laundry room are stairs accessing the optional basement and future bonus area. Follow the steps down to the basement where a whole new world awaits! The family recreation area has a game room with plenty of space for a pool table. Also in this space is a full bathroom. Located right off the rec room is a home theater with a snack area for those movie-time “munchies”! A safe room and large storage closet make the most of this below-ground space. The boat garage is accessible through a rec room door.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natural light spills in to the living area and the bedroom in this contemporary apartment that’s ideal for the young professional. There’s a workspace, comfortable bathroom with dual sinks, large bedroom, modern kitchen, terrace and a laundry and storage area
<br />Combine an eye-catching rugged exterior with a luxurious open layout, and you've got this outstanding plan. Through the foyer, the dining room is delineated by columns on the right. Ahead, the family room displays a tray ceiling and great views of the rear lanai. It's easy to entertain in this space; just pass snacks over the kitchen's bar. Another island gives extra prep space, so guests can sit and sip (or even help chop) at the bar while you finish up dinner and chat. A walk-in pantry keeps everything close at hand. Or when you feel like grilling, head out to the barbecue porch, where a two-sided fireplace warms up chilly nights.
