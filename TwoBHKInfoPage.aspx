Two bedrooms may not be a mansion, but with the right layout it can be plenty of space for a growing family or even a swinging single. The best apartment layout for any situation will depend on how important noise, light, and privacy are to its inhabitants. For instance, parents with a young child will likely prefer to have him or her right next door while two college roommates might prefer the bedrooms on opposite sides of the home. No matter what square footage you're working with, chances are you will be able to find some inspiration from these creative 3D renderings of two bedroom spaces        <br /><br />
