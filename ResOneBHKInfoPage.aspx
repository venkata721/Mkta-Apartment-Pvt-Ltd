The one bedroom apartment may be a hallmark for singles or young couples, but they don't have to be the stark and plain dwellings that call to mind horror stories of the "first apartment" blues. Take in these gorgeous one bedroom apartment and house plans that showcase modern design and unique layouts to boot! See? That one bedroom doesn't have to be uncomfortable. In fact, it can be quite the contrary!.

        This colorful single uses bright pops of color in its furnishings to liven up the neutral palette that brings together crisp and clean walls with light to medium hardwoods and natural tile. We especially love the lime green in the kitchen, dining, and living areas.
